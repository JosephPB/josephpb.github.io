My work focuses on understanding and simulating complex systems through the development of mathematical modelling and machine learning techniques at the intersection of physics, humanitarian and computational social sciences.

I am a Research Scientist/Associate, and previously Research Fellow, with [United Nations Global Pulse](https://www.beta.unglobalpulse.org), an innovation initiative of the UN Secretary-General to harness big data and emerging technologies for sustainable development and humanitarian action. Humanitarian situations are incredibly complex, especially given the propensity to have mutliple simultaneous, and often interacting, crises. Complex systems methods can help us understand these crises better and enable more informed preparation and contingency planning, mitigation measures, rapid response efforts, and medium-to-long-term recovery and resilience building. Mathematical and computational modelling tools such as agent-based approaches and machine learning techniques can be applied at different stages of the process. My research interests lie in piecing apart this complexity, developing new methods and models addressing specific components, and combining these together into broader mechanisms for supporting decision making and policy initiatives. In addition, a key component of this work is understanding and communicating uncertainites - including in the data, models, and overall decision making process.

Much of this work is deeply informed by my background in Physics. I optained my PhD from the [Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology](http://ippp.dur.ac.uk) at Durham University, the national centre for phenomenological research, and was part of the Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Intensive Science and Institute for Data Science there. My PhD research focused on investigating ways to apply and develop machine learning and mathematical modelling techniques for complex problems partiple physics, and also how these approches can be brought into the humanitarian domain to help address challenges in crisis response and disaster relief. As specific case studies, I worked on constructing high-dimensional functional approximationsto be used in large-scale particle collision simualtion and performing uncertainty analysis, as well as utilising many of the numerical modelling techniques developed in this field for agent-based epidemic modelling.

I also hold the position of Research Advisor at the [NYU Risk Econ Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/riskeconlab/), part of the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences, where I co-advise several Masters students.

Approaching these complex humanitarian challenges requires a wide variety of expertise and knowledge - including, economic, social, behavioural, political, geographical, computational, etc.. I enjoy working in multi-disciplinary teams with a range of backgrounds and have learnt, and continue to learn, a great deal from my colleagues in different departments and faculties. Much of my work has been done in collaboration these colleagues which is essential to making both theoretical and tangible change.
