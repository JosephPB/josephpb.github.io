(**Note:** Before April 2021 I published under Joseph Bullock)

I am a Doctoral Researcher at the [Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology](http://ippp.dur.ac.uk) at Durham University, and part of the Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Intensive Science and Institute for Data Science there. My PhD research focuses on investigating ways in which we can apply machine learning techniques to complex problems in particle physics, specifically constructing high-dimensional functional approximations and performing uncertainty analysis.

Alongside this work I am actively involved in interdisciplinary research, leveraging artificial intelligence to help address real-world humanitarian challenges. I hold a Research Fellowship with [UN Global Pulse](https://www.beta.unglobalpulse.org), an innovation initiative of the UN Secretary-General to harness big data for sustainable development and humanitarian action, where I work on a variety of projects including applying machine learning and data analysis techniques to remote sensing and textual analysis.

I am also an Industrial Research Associate at the [NYU Risk Econ Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/riskeconlab/), developing research in computer vision applications to satellite image analysis and co-advising several Masters students there.

My research interests include:

- Applying machine learning to complex scientific scenarios such as those in particle physics, specifically in the fields of high dimensional functional approximations, pattern and event detection
- Researching ways in which machine learning and data analytics can be used in real-world humanitarian scenarios and the implications of their applications
- Developing responsible methodological practices for the application of AI to human-sensitive scenarios
- Meaningfully understanding errors and their uncertainties in machine learning methodologies

A selection of projects I have worked on can be found on the [Projects](https://josephpb.github.io/projects) page.
