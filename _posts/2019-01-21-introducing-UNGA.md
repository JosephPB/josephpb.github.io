Joseph is an Artificial Research Fellow at [UN Global Pulse](https://www.unglobalpulse.net), an innovation initiative of the UN Secretary-General to harness big data for sustainable development and humanitarian action, where he works on a variety of projects include remote sensing using satellite images, and NLP for social media analysis. He is also an Industrial Research Associate at the [NYU Risk Econ Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/riskeconlab/), where he is developing research in computer vision applications to satellite image analysis. Joseph combines this with being a Doctoral Researcher at the [Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology](https://wp.nyu.edu/riskeconlab/), Durham University, focussing on applying machine learning to approximating high dimensional scattering amplitude calculations. He is also associated to the [Institute for Data Science](https://www.dur.ac.uk/idas/) at Durham University.

Joseph's research interests include:

- Applying Machine Learning solutions to complex scientific scenarios such as those in particle physics, specifically in the fields of high-dimensional functional approximations, pattern and event detction
- Researching ways in which Machine Learning and Data Analytics can be used in real-world humanitarian scenarios and the implications of their applications
- Developing responsible methodological practices for the application of AI to human-sensitive scenarios
