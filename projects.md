## Refugee Camp Mapping

Refugee camps can be highly dynamical and constantly experience a state of flux. In order to understand their extend, populations and density, [UNOSAT](https://unitar.org/sustainable-development-goals/satellite-analysis-and-applied-research) are regularly requested to produce maps of the camps from satellite imagery. This is vital work and provides and essential source of information for the aid agencies and NGOs working there. The mapping process, however, is highly manual and can take many hours for an analyst to successfully map the camp. By working with UNOSAT we have developed a tool for automatically mapping refugee camps across the Middle East and North Africa, saving countless hours for analysts and allowing them to repond faster when information is required.

## Automated Flood Mapping

After catastrophic events, situational information is critical to response teams. Flood maps showing the extent of the affected areas are provided by teams at [UNOSAT](https://unitar.org/sustainable-development-goals/satellite-analysis-and-applied-research) through their rapid mapping service. Current methods largely include semi-automatic pixel intensity thresholding on Sentinal-1 radar images which take approximately 6 hours to be performed by human analysts. Using a Machine Learning model this process has been automated, saving considerable time for the analysts, while attaining the high degree of accuracy required.

## Damage Detection

Post-event damage analysis plays a crucial role in directing response team resources. By using pre-event and post-even satellite imagery, combined with methods for automatic object detetion and classification, damage detection can be automated over extremely large regions. By providing up-to-dat rapid damage assessments, response teams can better allocate resources and provide assistance more rapidly.
