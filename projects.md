## Refugee Camp Mapping

Refugee camps can be highly dynamical and constantly experience a state of flux. In order to understand their extend, populations and density, [UNOSAT](https://unitar.org/sustainable-development-goals/satellite-analysis-and-applied-research) are regularly requested to produce maps of the camps from satellite imagery. This is vital work and provides and essential source of information for the aid agencies and NGOs working there. The mapping process, however, is highly manual and can take many hours for an analyst to successfully map the camp. By working with UNOSAT we have developed a tool for automatically mapping refugee camps across the Middle East and North Africa, saving countless hours for analysts and allowing them to repond faster when information is required.
