## Publications

My [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=rzqW5b0AAAAJ&hl=en) contains the most up to date list of publications.

**Note:** I now publish under my legal name, Joseph Aylett-Bullock. Before April 2021 I published under Joseph Bullock.

**Note:** Given the sensitivity of my current work, my academic publications are now less regular; however, I still engage in research and development which I will publish when possible
